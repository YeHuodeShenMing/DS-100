    "You've seen some `matplotlib` in this class already (in homework 1), but now we will explain how to work with the object-oriented plotting API mentioned in this [matplotlib.pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html). In `matplotlib`, plotting occurs on a set of `Axes` that are associated with a `Figure`. An analogy is that on a blank canvas (`Figure`), you choose a location to plot (`Axes`) and then fill it in (plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to labeling and manipulating figure contents, which we'll discuss below. Approach 1 is closest to the plotting paradigm of MATLAB, the namesake of `matplotlib`; Approach 2 is also common because many `matplotlib`-based packages (such as `seaborn`) explicitly return the current set of axes after plotting data. Both are essentially equivalent, and at the end of this class, you'll be comfortable with both. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 1**: `matplotlib` will auto-plot onto the current set of `Axes` or (if none exists) create a new figure/set of default axes. You can plot data using methods from `plt`, which is shorthand for the `matplotlib.pyplot` package. Then subsequent `plt` calls all edit the same set of default-created axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 2**:  \n",
